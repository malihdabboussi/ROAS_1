# Changelog - August 18, 2026

## [2026-08-18 00:04] - [FIX]
What: Stopped the meeting agenda Space Doc from remounting on every autosave. Open transcript is now a text link beside Open recording. Link recording sits under those links. Action items sit in the top row beside Recordings & attachments.
Why: Realtime UPDATE on the agenda row remounted the editor after the 1s autosave, so "Loading document..." flickered every 1-2 seconds. Transcript used a button under the recording link, Link recording lived in the section header, and action items were buried at the bottom.
Impact: Agenda stays open while it saves. Recording actions read as Open recording · Open transcript, then Link recording. Action items are in the top-right column under that row.
