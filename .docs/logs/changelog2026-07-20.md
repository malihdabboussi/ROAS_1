# Changelog - July 20, 2026

## 2026-07-20 07:49 - [FIX]

What: Reset copied Google Doc character and paragraph formatting before reapplying Task 16 headings and emphasis, collapse consecutive duplicate lines, and reject post-webinar email/SMS sequences placed in P4 instead of tab 7.

Why: Launch Bible content could inherit underline, highlight, font size, indentation, and alignment from the master template. The compiler also allowed duplicate source lines and did not enforce the difference between replay landing-page copy and replay follow-up messages.

Impact: Newly compiled Webinar Launch Bibles use clean Arial body text with intentional headings, avoid consecutive duplicate content, keep P4 limited to on-page replay copy, and route replay delivery and post-webinar follow-up to 7 - SMS & Emails.

## 2026-07-20 08:07 - [FIX]

What: Set copywriter agents to Claude Opus 4.8 by default, made Dylan Super Voice an always-loaded copywriter rule, repaired the voice skill and model for existing Webinar copywriters, and added a deterministic Launch Bible rejection for client-facing em dashes.

Why: Copywriting tasks used mission-worker `auto`, which resolved to Claude Sonnet 4.6, while prompt-only voice instructions could be skipped. Task 16 then preserved invalid source copy instead of detecting the violation.

Impact: New and existing copywriters use Opus 4.8, must load Dylan Super Voice before drafting, and cannot compile client-facing Webinar copy with em dashes into the final Launch Bible.
