# Changelog - August 17, 2026

## [2026-08-17 00:45] - [FIX]

What: Fixed the chat HTML artifact PR so `next build` typecheck passes: `ChatMarkdownDocument` now types the mermaid/code/markdown segment union, and unused download mock params are prefixed.

Why: Vercel `roas-web` failed on PR #243 because `flatMap` inferred an incompatible segment union and `noUnusedParameters` flagged the artifact download mocks.

Impact: Preview deploy for clickable chat HTML/CSS/SVG cards can compile. Merge of `main` into `claude/chat-code-artifacts` is included.

## [2026-08-17 00:09] - [FIX]

What: Stop Spaces `?space=&item=` deep-link crash (React #185) by ending the missing-space reload storm, preferring URL space on load, resolving missing spaces via fetch-by-id once, and stabilizing org/work-context updates on Open ROAS task links.

Why: Opening a finalized Service Request task white-screened the app. Console showed Maximum update depth exceeded; `useSpaceUrlViewSync` reloaded on every `spaces` identity change when the target space was absent (wrong org / beyond first page), cascading setStates.

Impact: Open ROAS task / `/spaces?space=&item=` deep links no longer infinite-loop; org-param switches clear stale space snapshots; work-context updates no-op when unchanged.
